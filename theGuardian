The debate over his status  part-time or frontline  will probably go on for as long as hes the main spin bowler in the England XI. The bottom line, though, is that he has taken big wickets. No wicket here, though.

In some sense that would be justified (to different degrees with each of the bowlers), but in another might it be a worrying sign of a return to 90s-style constant changes with the instability, insecurity, and sad failures to fulfil potential that that brought with it.

From the penultimate ball of the over Pujara gets himself into a right tangle with a Woakes short ball, first planning to play it, then planning to leave it, then trying to play it again, and ending up almost head-butting his wafting blade.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T16:24:32.391+01:00&quot;&gt;4.24pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woakes replaces Broad, but it might be Broad who has taken a wicket. A very sharp single is taken to Broad at mid-on. He charges in a bowls under-arm stumpwards. This looks out to me  the third umpire takes a very, very long look at it. And it is indeed out. A great bit of fielding from Broad.

That looked close but Rod Tucker said no. Had he the option, Broad (needless to say) wouldve reviewed it  but it wouldve been a wasted review.

He then steps away to the leg side and slaps straight down the ground, bring up a fine fifty from just 38 balls. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T15:07:03.787+01:00&quot;&gt;3.07pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;39th over: England 182-3 (Cook 64, Root 39) - lead of 421&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook throws his hands at a few and doesnt register much but some singles. Should blame his high-middled bat - perfect for his standard game, but not for some slaps. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T15:03:39.744+01:00&quot;&gt;3.03pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38th over: England 177-3 (Cook 61, Root 38) - lead of 417&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook steps across to Kumar and hoiks him behind square, where Pankaj Singh fields the ball and then falls arse over tit, allowing three runs. Theres a noise later on as Cook swings at one which goes between bat and pad, but it turns out to be the ball brushing of his back leg. A full ball is then slapped behind point to the boundary rider. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India&#39;s highest successful run chase in England is 174&#x2F;6 at Lords in 1971 &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hashtag&#x2F;EngvInd?src=hash&quot;&gt;#EngvInd&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:56:12.048+01:00&quot;&gt;2.56pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37th over: England 168-3 (Cook 57, Rooy 33) - lead of 407&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shami on at this end and Cook pulls, albeit out of time, for a single. Root has a swipe at a wide one but misses, before Shami closes out the over with a length ball that Root pings into the gap at midwicket for four.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:51:51.256+01:00&quot;&gt;2.51pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36th over: England 163-3 (Cook 56, Root 29) - lead of 402&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumar into the attack after drinks. Dhonis up to the stumps for Root and back for Cook, who finds the man in the deep with a cut shot. Two runs from the over.

As we are 1-0 down in the series and have been in the ascendancy all game, a draw would be massive body blow. Hence the need for a little urgency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:42:17.694+01:00&quot;&gt;2.42pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35th over: England 161-3 (Cook 55, Root 28) - lead of 400&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Root the recipient of more filth, this time from Jadeja, which he again hits through square leg for four. Root is then square up by a devilish ball, which turns and bounces past the outside edge and beyond Dhoni for four byes. Now Cook pings a sweep for four. Quality few overs from Englands perspective. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:38:38.959+01:00&quot;&gt;2.38pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34th over: England 148-3 (Cook 51, Root 23) - lead of 387&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horror ball first up from Sharma which Root hits around the corner for four. He then pushes the outfielders well and gets two. Another shoddy delivery, this time outside off stump, is smoked through the covers for another boundary. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:35:58.298+01:00&quot;&gt;2.35pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33rd over: England 137-3 (Cook 51, Root 12) - lead of 376&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strike swapping, before Cook sweeps hard and Shami can only parry the ball into the sponge. He moves to his second half century of the match, this one off 93 balls, with five boundaries. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:33:04.187+01:00&quot;&gt;2.33pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32nd over: England 131-3 (Cook 47, Root 11) - lead of 371&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rohit Sharma into the attack and Cook and Root exchange the strike with cuts, whips and pulls (ooo err). Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Martin Hamilton&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; lays down the law: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fan in the crowd shouts &amp;quot;Get on with it&amp;quot; as Cook leaves a couple outside off stump.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:28:16.310+01:00&quot;&gt;2.28pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31st over: England 127-3 (Cook 44, Root 9) - lead 366&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Root works one with his wrists to square leg for a single, before Cook fails to get anything worthwhile on a big sweep. He gets more on the next attempt, to the last ball of the over, which goes for two. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:25:11.687+01:00&quot;&gt;2.25pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30th over: England 124-3 (Cook 42, Root 8) - lead of 363&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looked like these two were just dealing in singles until Root punches nicely off the back foot for three. Then Cook, also back, somehow evades the two gullies with an uncontrolled thick edge. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:20:00.298+01:00&quot;&gt;2.20pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29th over: England 117-3 (Cook 39, Root 4) - lead of 356&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook tickles one fine of leg slip and gets a four. Jadeja fires one in and Cook, more or less, just pads it away. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:16:52.891+01:00&quot;&gt;2.16pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28th over: England 112-3 (Cook 35, Root 2) - lead of 351&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Root is off his hip for a single before Cook bunts a few back to the bowler. He skews one to deep point for one and Root is tested with some short stuff. Rolled wrists on the final ball gives him the strike. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:11:34.898+01:00&quot;&gt;2.11pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27th over: England 109-3 (Cook 34, Root 1)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all due respect to Rooteh, it was a bit of a shame seeing him walk out after Bell dismissal. Surely a great time to promote either Jos Buttler or Chris Jordan? Hes off the mark second ball, playing Jadeja inside out for a single into the offside. Cook sweeps hard and hits the ball through a forward square-leg. There are shouts of catch it, but it looks like it just fell short. Perhaps a gun fielder would have dived forward, having judged the dip quicker. Shami is by no means that gun fielder. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:08:23.640+01:00&quot;&gt;2.08pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell tries to sweep a full ball just outside leg stump which turns and might have even caught a bit of pad, before going onto his stumps. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:05:53.941+01:00&quot;&gt;2.05pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26th over: England 106-2 (Cook 32, Bell 23) - lead of 345&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell doesnt time this one, but he does get it over the infield and trickling to the extra cover boundary for four. Hes not quite on the next one, either, which he lobs high to the legside for a couple. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts on Kallis written in 2010.

Kallis found it hard-going, so he asked (I think) Mark Boucher: Man, this is tough. What altitude are we at?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:00:10.828+01:00&quot;&gt;2.00pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25th over: England 99-2 (Cook 32, Bell 16) - lead of 338&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sweep takes Cook off strike again, as he goes against the heavy offside field (7-2) by walking across and reaching for the ball. Bell then reverse sweeps in a watchful manner to guide a slower ball behind square leg for another single. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T13:57:04.298+01:00&quot;&gt;1.57pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24th over: England 97-2 (Cook 31, Bell 15) - lead of 336&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Areas from Singh, as he arcs a good length away singer at Bell, who follows it. Bell nearly chops on the next ball, which is a fraction short but on a decent line. Bell then attempts to drive him on the up but doesnt time it as it bounces once on the way to mid off.

I shortened my 4.30pm meeting to a couple of minutes and raced to the Oval. That evening and the following morning I saw both score a century. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T13:39:46.152+01:00&quot;&gt;1.39pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first few tributes are in...&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 - Jacques Kallis is the only player to score 20,000+ runs and take 500+ wickets in international cricket.

Ballance then sweeps fine, as Shami comes around and stops it, old-school with his feet. The fifth ball is walloped for six, as he clears his front leg, comes inside the line and hits over long-off.

A two is aborted because of sharp Indian work in the deep, which almost has Ballance in trouble as he slips on the lush green grass just off the pitch.

Cook in danger of complicating things here as he sets up a hook-trap as Shami tries and fails to hit the final ball over the cordon. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T11:11:29.054+01:00&quot;&gt;11.11am &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cracking ball from Anderson seams in and lifts on Dhoni, who is late on a pull and gets nothing but fists to the ball, which lops safely into the hands of Buttler. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T11:09:59.414+01:00&quot;&gt;11.09am &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given Englands position in this five Test series,&lt;strong&gt; Robert Moore &lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;feels the follow-on is a must. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we were 1-0 up in the series I think not enforcing the follow up would be the obvious choice. But surely with us 1-0 down and needing to win this game we have to give ourselves the most amount of time we can to get 20 wickets  which means sticking them in again. If it backfires and we end up having to bat a tricky fourth innings then so be it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T11:09:04.687+01:00&quot;&gt;11.09am &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;104th over: India 329-8 (Dhoni 50, Shami 5)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broad is back of a length and into the body of Shami, who takes his hand off the bat and dabs it into the off side. Shami then stays leg side of the next ball - full, bit of in-nip - and its pushed through the offside for just a single. Dhoni charges one and then is happy to take the single into a deserted legside ring, entrusting Shami with the last two deliveries. Broad goes for the body again but its byes down the legside. Shami wants one, Dhoni declines. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T11:05:35.318+01:00&quot;&gt;11.05am &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Nicholas Clark &lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;gives us a third opinion:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they dont get the runs then it will be early in the day when our bowlers should still be fresh from their overnight rest. If we dont enforce the follow on then timing the declaration is difficult. We really need to win this game as the best option is to back our batsman to chase down the 150-200 that we should need to get. If they get much more than that we are knackered anyway and the game should end in a draw. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T11:04:25.249+01:00&quot;&gt;11.04am &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;103rd over: India 323-8 (Dhoni 50, Shami 4)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flicky-wristed fend to the first ball as the camera pans out and shows point making his way to the boundary. Wonder whether Dhoni will take the single to the man. A couple of outswingers are left, an inducker is smothered. The field come in for the final two balls and Dhoni charges and misses a wide one. Not sure whether thats smart or not, but the final ball is speared down the leg side and Buttler stops it superbly. No bye, no wides, no boundary and Mohammed Shami on strike to Broad. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T11:00:07.497+01:00&quot;&gt;11.00am &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philipp Lohan &lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;comes to the OBO parish seeking advice from the masses, as Dhoni and Shami make their way to the middle:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At what state in todays play, I should decide to head down to Southampton for Day 5?

When a team gets close to avoiding it, if you put them in again, you run the risk of them getting a big score second time round (which certainly isnt beyond this Indian team) and leaving you an awkward target. Id not be confident about England chasing any target, let alone an awkward one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T10:53:01.429+01:00&quot;&gt;10.53am &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Beckell has a cunning plan...&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If England either dont enforce the follow-on, or India get the runs required, and England bat again, might a left-field decision be to open with Cook and Buttler?

They will face Australia. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T17:29:28.381+01:00&quot;&gt;5.29pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Sorry for the delay)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada&#39;s David TREMBLAY wins gold in the men&#39;s freestyle wrestling -61kg &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hashtag&#x2F;2014wrestling?src=hash&quot;&gt;#2014wrestling&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T17:28:47.379+01:00&quot;&gt;5.28pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max Whitlock has been chatting to the press after he clinched gold today:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main aim was to go and perform clean routines and Im so happy that I managed to do that on the day. I wasnt paying much attention to the scores, I wanted to have clean routines and that was it so to have that comfortable margin at the end felt really good. I cant actually explain it, its a crazy thing. Even before the routine I was so nervous and to stick the landing (on high bar, the final apparatus) like that was amazing ...&lt;em&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;Since London 2012 all-around has been a massive target so to pull this off is massive for me. Its a big marker for the world championships, experience-wise and confidence-wise it gives me a big push to that. I will be training really hard and hopefully I can get some more skills in there which would be great ...&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The depth of the sport is really good at the moment, you have got juniors like Nile [Wilson] that have gone and got a bronze medal and there are more juniors to come that will come through and pushing the seniors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T17:24:56.164+01:00&quot;&gt;5.24pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another round of pictures:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T17:19:06.188+01:00&quot;&gt;5.19pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India have struck back just as it looked like South Africa were taking total control of the contest.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; 3-2 it is.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T17:17:51.512+01:00&quot;&gt;5.17pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usain Bolt is too media savvy to have put his foot in it but it must be said that Glasgow 2014 has been a glorious success, reckons Andy Bull.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Here are his thoughts on said subject:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, thats let the cat out of the bag. Usain Bolt, in an unguarded moment, has reportedly let slip that he thinks the Commonwealth Games are a bit shit, and that the Olympics are better.

The man is surely too smart, too PR savvy, to have knowingly made such remarks on the record, which is why he wisely &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;sport&#x2F;2014&#x2F;jul&#x2F;26&#x2F;usain-bolt-commonwealth-games-athletics&quot;&gt;chose not to offer an opinion on the situation in Gaza&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; when he was asked about it on Saturday.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he said it, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;sport&#x2F;2014&#x2F;jul&#x2F;30&#x2F;usain-bolt-commonwealth-games-2014&quot;&gt;and he has described the story as nonsense and lies&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it would be the first and worst false step he has taken since he shot out of the blocks a split second too soon and was &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;sport&#x2F;2011&#x2F;aug&#x2F;28&#x2F;usain-bolt-disqualified-100m-blake&quot;&gt;disqualified from the 100m&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; final at the world championships in 2011.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T17:14:31.053+01:00&quot;&gt;5.14pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The India defenders let their minds wander for a moment or two and Illse Davids capitalises, firing in a superb shot from a tight angle. &lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;3-1 to South Africa.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T17:11:44.149+01:00&quot;&gt;5.11pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is more womens hockey underway. &lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;This time it is India versus South Africa.

Everything went to plan, I stuck to the tactics and I think that is what it is all about. If you stick to the tactics and listen to the coaches you will always do well. She was a really game fighter I have got to give her credit, she never gave up and kept coming forward ..&lt;em&gt;.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everybody is a challenge for me at this weight. Everybody wants to be the new Nicola Adams, everybody wants to beat me and take the No.1 spot.

Its Devi v Jones. The first round is even enough. Plenty of slipping and sliding but nothing much landing from either boxer. All three judges favour Jones. Round two. Devi lands a couple of flush and early shots on Jones as she traps her opponent on the ropes. Jones tries to fight back and eventually finds her way out of a sticky situation. Jones bobs and weaves and avoids a few more shots but Devi was in control. That round was hers. Round three. The opening exchanges are furious though Devi may have just got the better of the flurry. They keep going toe-to-toe and Devi keeps coming out on top. Two judges plump for Devi. Final round. Once more it starts at quite the pace. Devi lands a nice left-right combination. Jones tries to counter but Devi picks her off with a left. Jones gets a few late and decent punches in and both raise their fists when the bell goes. Both think they are through but it is Devi who screams in success. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T16:30:07.858+01:00&quot;&gt;4.30pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is a quick take on the mens gymnastics from the wires:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max Whitlock has claimed his first individual all-around gold medal at a major competition after a stunning display at the Commonwealth Games at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 21-year-old double Olympic bronze medallist added to the team gold England won on Tuesday with a near immaculate performance which underlines him as a serious medal prospect for the World Championships this October and for the Rio Games in two years time. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T16:28:35.696+01:00&quot;&gt;4.28pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For some time now it has looked like Whitlock was going to take gold in mens gymnastics and that has finally been confirmed with a sensational turn on his final apparatus,&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the high bar routine. &lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;He won with a score of 90.361 with Scotlands Keatings in second (88.298) and Nile Wilson (87.965) took third.

Its Englands Nicola Adams against Erandi de Silva of Sri Lanka in the 51kg quarter-final. Adams, as you would expect, gets a rapturous welcome. De Silva starts with a hard left hook and takes it to Adams. The English woman skips and slips and hits some straight shots, forcing De Silva onto the ropes. The Sri Lanka fighter lands another decent left hook but is nothing compared to the one that Adams sends her to the floor with just before the bell. Thats Adams round. The opening to the second is scrappy but Adams wriggles away and lands a right ... and then my screen goes green once more and I have no feed once more. Just before the bell, a corkscrew left is followed by an over-the-top right and a left hook that has De Silva stumbling backwards. Adams wins round two. Round three. Adams switches to south paw but keeps in control. She drops her guard, daring De Silva to go for it. De Silva aint that stupid. The Sri Lankan is taking quite a few shots now. Adams dominates and has surely won that one too. She has. Round four. Adams drives her opponent backwards right away. De Silva swings wildly and hits nowt but fresh air. Adams is in total control, picking De Silva off. The last action of the fight is De Silvas head snapping back due to a serious left from Adams. Adams is into the semi-finals. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T15:54:49.144+01:00&quot;&gt;3.54pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Zealand ended up winning 6-0 by the way. &lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T15:48:27.737+01:00&quot;&gt;3.48pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another retort from below the line to Bolts alleged comments:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commonwealth Games are important and have a vital role to play.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most established stars don&#39;t give them as much priority as other events, for the other up and coming athletes they are vital. This is the competition at which they make their first big break on an international stage. Denis Lewis, Colin Jackson, Barry McGuiganm, David WIlkie are to name but a few whose international breakthrough happened here.

The husband-and-wife pairing, who received a first-round bye, eased to a 21-12 21-13 win over Northern Irelands Tony Murphy and Alannah Stephenson in the second round at the Emirates Arena. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adcocks were on court just 26 minutes and, after a day off following the team competition final on Monday, felt their return to action went well. Gabby Adcock said: It was about getting the job done today and saving as much energy as we can for the later matches. There are a lot of good pairs out there and being top seeds doesnt make a difference. We have just got to focus on ourselves. Were really enjoying playing here and not feeling too much pressure. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T15:18:22.162+01:00&quot;&gt;3.18pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gymnastics: Incredible image of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DanKeatings&quot;&gt;@DanKeatings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - Off to a flyer in the Men&#39;s Individual event. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hashtag&#x2F;GoScotland?src=hash&quot;&gt;#GoScotland&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.co&#x2F;6GgMRhH9TG&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com&#x2F;6GgMRhH9TG&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T15:18:05.202+01:00&quot;&gt;3.18pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to the hockey where Canada are now officially getting, eh, hockeyed by New Zealand.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; It was 2-0 when we last checked in, its now 5-0.

OK men&#39;s 100 m gets most attention, but for me both men&#39;s and women&#39;s gymnastics beats 100 m for dedication, strength and grace.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:43:22.897+01:00&quot;&gt;2.43pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A touch more reaction from below the line on Bolts alleged comments:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No times under 10 sec in the final?

El-Mais is not the only quarter-final winner. Efetobor Apochi has defeated Jai Opetaia and celebrated with a couple of flips around the ring. Up now is Scotlands Stephen Lavelle against 6ft5s Amritpreet Amritpreet Singh. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:29:58.314+01:00&quot;&gt;2.29pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three apparatus have been completed in the mens gymnastics. &lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;With those under the belt. Whitlock is in first with a score of 46.065.

The home crowd roared their team on in this winner-take-all pool match  and somewhere a piper played Flower of Scotland  but a fighting display from the home team could not overturn Englands 2-1 lead, despite a second half full of opportunities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second half was just nervy, and Scotland played really well, said Englands coach Danny Kerry. I was reasonably pleased with the way we started but in the second half you could see us go a little bit nervous and they fed off that. But we still had some very clear-cut chances to put the game beyond doubt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:18:38.583+01:00&quot;&gt;2.18pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max Whitlock has retaken the lead in the gymnastics. &lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T14:15:08.822+01:00&quot;&gt;2.15pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is more womens hockey action this afternoon with New Zealand taking on Canada.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; As it stands, the Kiwis are one to the good. Meanwhile in the mens gymnastics, the action is really hotting up. As it stands (midway through the rings), Scotlands Dan Keatings is in the lead, David Bishop of New Zealand is in second and Australias Sean OHara is in third.

Danson and Townsend struck inside the first half-hour, with Nikki Kidd slotting a consolation strike for the Scots. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T13:41:55.056+01:00&quot;&gt;1.41pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emma John is up in Glasgow and casting her expert eye over the gymnastics.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Here is what she has to say about the competition so far today:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max Whitlock is third after first round of the gymnastics all around mens final.

Incidentally Bolt was approached by journalists from the Daily Mail and the Associated Press for a comment on todays Times story that the Commonwealth Games was a bit shit but Bolts entourage immediately called for security and the pair had to make a sharpish exit from the VIP area.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usain is just frustrated that he cant roam about, but it was like that at London 2012. He basically goes to training and comes back. You can only play so many video games in your room. Hes a free spirit, but it requires security organisation when he wants to roam. He even gets a bagman [an assistant] to get his food from the canteen because it would create too much of a stir if he was there. But one thing is for sure, he is enjoying himself in Glasgow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T13:24:21.078+01:00&quot;&gt;1.24pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The action in the pool may be done and dusted but the diving is ready to step in and replace it.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; And it hasnt taken long for England to garner their first medal in the the competition via the 10-metre platform and the skills of Sarah Barrow and Tonia Couch. Says the wires: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Englands Sarah Barrow and Tonia Couch had to settle for silver in the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games womens synchronised 10-metre platform on day one of the diving competition at the Royal Commonwealth Pool in Edinburgh. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plymouth pair led after four of their five dives but were overtaken on the final dive as Canadas Meaghan Benfeito and Roseline Filion won gold with a score of 310.65. Barrow and Couch finished with a score of 306.96 and Malaysias Pamg Pandelela Rinong and Sabri Nur Dhabitah (300.12) claimed bronze. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T13:17:12.710+01:00&quot;&gt;1.17pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There has been some red hot action on the track already today and it has seen Dai Greene relinquish the 400m title that he picked up in Delhi four years ago. &lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;Here is what the wires have to say about his early exit.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dai Greene always knew retaining his Commonwealth crown would be beyond him, but the former world 400 metres hurdles champion was not going to pass up the opportunity of represent Wales at Glasgow 2014. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years on from winning gold in Delhi, the 28-year-old failed to make it out of the heats at Hampden Park after struggling on Wednesday morning. Greene has barely raced this year due to injury and that lack of fitness showed as he tailed off dramatically towards the end of his heat, crossing the line fifth in 50.36 seconds - way off his personal best of 47.84 secs. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;block-time published-time&quot;&gt; &lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-07-30T13:11:36.151+01:00&quot;&gt;1.11pm &lt;span class=&quot;timezone&quot;&gt;BST&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;time&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In case you had other more important things to do yesterday than laze about on the couch, remote in one hand and beer in the other, quickly becoming an expert on everything from floor routines in gymnastics to the finer points of cross-country mountain-biking, then here is a quick recap of what went down in Glasgow&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.

Depardieu looks like hell and the Cannes film festival audience is in uproar. Each drag of his belly is accompanied by disbelieving hoots and embarrassed guffaws. The audience can&#39;t decide whether it&#39;s witnessing the death throes of a legend or the convulsive birth of a new kind of screen nudity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies to the aesthetes, but naked bodies sell movies. It&#39;s a truism that goes right back to film&#39;s disreputable beginnings as a peep-show at the circus. It&#39;s the unspoken contract at the heart of arthouse cinema, with its habit of employing perky gamines to sweeten challenging drama. But now the old model is breaking down, outstripped by the new flesh of sagging torsos and dangling genitalia  what some describe as &amp;quot;horror nudity&amp;quot; and others as a different kind of beauty.

This was particularly deadly in that the mortality rate was 88%. Most outbreaks have not been quite so lethal, with about 60% being the norm. But for any infection this is staggeringly high.

But the evidence does not seem to be on their side&lt;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For UK cyclists the issue of compulsory helmet use has been until now, to use the phrase, a quarrel in a faraway land, with the main proponents being Australia, New Zealand and parts of Canada and the US. But now it has arrived on our shores.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-jersey-28319979&quot;&gt;Earlier this month&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; all children aged under 14 on the Channel Island of Jersey who ride a bike without a helmet risk a &amp;pound;50 fine for their parents. The law has been progressing for a long time, first mooted in 2010 covering all cyclists.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the legislation is that if you can get children into the habit of wearing a helmet younger, that should say with them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldnt say were confident. Were going to have to look at the numbers and see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those figures [about helmet compulsion hampering cyclist numbers] dont stack up, and Im even more confident when were talking about children. I can only talk from Jersey experience, but I believe children participating in cycling will increase after the law, based on the number of phone calls Ive had from parents saying, I want little Johnny to wear a helmet. He wont wear it because his friends wont wear one. Therefore I wont let him have a bike.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I dont think you can put that at the door of cycle helmets. Thats happening anyway. I think Jersey has a higher rate of activity participation. Its not going to put people off. Its only for children. The evidence I see is that more children will cycle, based on what parents are saying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont really care about the macho twits who duck in and out of city traffic wearing headphones but no helmet, without a thought for the mothers and girlfriends who will pick up their pieces.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont really care about the lazy twits who duck in and out of fast food restaurants eating burgers but taking no exercise, without a thought for the wives and children who will pick up their pieces of their diabetes or stroke or heart attack.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you just save one life, or save one life from being blighted, its worth it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an argument for improving infrastructure for cyclists generally, but its not cheap and it doesnt happen quickly, particularly on old roads where theres not a lot of room to provide segregation. That doesnt mean we shouldnt give up pushing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;bike-blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;jul&#x2F;30&#x2F;jersey-compulsory-cycle-helmet-law-emotion-not-evidence&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;</Say>

He first came to public attention as a contestant in the TV cookery competition MasterChef, then became a regular on the BBC series Ready Steady Cook and a favourite private chef of stars such as Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Known for his charm as much as for the culinary skills he had learned from his grandmother as a child, he was once dubbed &amp;quot;the tastiest man in Britain&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Taradale, in the Hawke&#39;s Bay region of North Island, New Zealand, he was adopted by Kelvin Burden, an electrician, and his wife, Anne, and described his childhood as idyllic. He told a New Zealand magazine: &amp;quot;As a kid, we had a bach [beach house] in Mahia. We&#39;d have breakfast, then bugger off for the day, either to the beach or the swamp to catch frogs. A pocket knife, stick of bamboo and piece of string could keep you entertained for hours.&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;tv-and-radio&#x2F;2014&#x2F;jul&#x2F;29&#x2F;ross-burden&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;</Say>
